# Reading Challenge Webinar

This is the repo for my webinar, "Building an App from Scratch with Shared State (and Why You Donâ€™t Need Redux)". I know, super clever title.

If you'd like to see the beginning state of the repo, use [this tree here](https://github.com/cassidoo/reading-challenge-webinar/tree/4241ae4c536f10089303bdc4b0b09b023c6cd613). If you'd like to see the final state, after the live coding, just look at the latest on the master branch.
